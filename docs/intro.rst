Introduction
************

Calls2xls is intended to simplify interpredation and reporting of results from next-generation sequencing variant call experiments. Calls2xls generates an output in the well-known MS Excel format (either the 2003 or 2007 version) and collates information information on programs and versions used in the analysis, sequencing depth, target regions, and annotated variant calls. The Calls2xls scripts further fascilitates integration with genomic viewers such as the `Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) <http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/>`_ or `Alamut Visual <http://www.interactive-biosoftware.com/alamut-visual/>`_ to enable simple viewing and interpretation of variants and data quality. Additionally, Calls2xls fascilitates creation and updating of a local variant database to track the frequency of variants that are found in-house and uses this data for annotation of new calls. If Alamut visual is used at the laboratory, Calls2xls is also able to annotate variants using classifications that have been saved previously in Alamut.

Calls2xls has been developed as a companion to the `bcbio-nextgen variant calling pipeline <https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
